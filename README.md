 Crafting Driven MMORPG

Made with Unity 3D C#, Fishnetworking, and using EdgeGap web hosting. Starting the game from the Server scene hosts the game's server, while starting the game from the Client scene allows users to connect to that server. The Server can be started in 2 different modes by toggling Host or Server on the Server Scene's Network Manager. Host allows the Server host to also play as a client.
